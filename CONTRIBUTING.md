# eAI Contribution Guide

## In short
1. Avoid duplicate work, issues, PRs etc.
2. Also consider contributing something other than code.
3. Create a draft PR before starting work on non-small changes.
4. Clearly explain your changes when submitting a PR.
5. Don't submit stuff that's broken.
6. Avoid making unnecessary changes, especially if they're purely based on your personal
   preferences.
7. Fork the repo and submit a PR.

## Why instructions like these are necessary
"We value all contributions". After all, we are an open-source
project, so we should welcome any input that people are willing to give, right?
Well, the reality is that contributions are SUPER-valuable.
